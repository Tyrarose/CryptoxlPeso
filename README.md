# CryptoxlPeso

A Node.js application that converts cryptocurrency values to Philippine Peso.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
* Vercel CLI (if you want to use `vercel dev`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Tyrarose/CryptoxlPeso.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Tyrarose/CryptoxlPeso.git)
    cd CryptoxlPeso
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Node.js server:**

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    This will start your application. Open your browser and navigate to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) to view it.

2.  **Using Vercel CLI for local development (optional):**

    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```

    If your project is designed for deployment on Vercel, this command will simulate the Vercel environment locally. This is especially useful if you are using serverless functions.

### Usage

Enter the cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH) and the amount to convert. The converted value in Philippine Peso will be displayed.

### Deployment

1.  Install the Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel` or `yarn global add vercel`
2.  Run `vercel` in your project's root directory.
3.  Follow the prompts to deploy.
